GrabNet is a peer-to-peer protocol for publishing and hosting websites on a decentralized network. Unlike traditional hosting, your site gets a permanent, stable address that never changes—even when you update the content. Think of it as "git for websites" meets "BitTorrent for hosting."

## Why GrabNet?

### The Problem with Current Solutions

**Traditional Hosting**: Centralized servers mean single points of failure, censorship vulnerability, and ongoing costs.

**IPFS**: Great for content-addressed storage, but:
- Addresses change on every update (content-addressed)
- IPNS is slow (30+ seconds to resolve)
- No first-class website concepts
- Requires pinning services or your own infrastructure
- No delta updates (re-upload everything)
- Depends on HTTP gateways for web access

### How GrabNet Solves These

| Problem | Traditional | IPFS | GrabNet |
|---------|-------------|------|---------|
| Address stability | ✅ Fixed | ❌ Changes on update | ✅ Stable forever |
| Name resolution | ✅ Fast DNS | ❌ IPNS is slow | ✅ <100ms via DHT |
| Update efficiency | ✅ Incremental | ❌ Full re-upload | ✅ Delta sync |
| **Storage efficiency** | ❌ N copies of every byte | ⚠️ Per-CID dedup only | ✅ **Global chunk dedup + erasure coding** |
| **Per-node burden as network grows** | ❌ Grows linearly | ❌ Full pin per host | ✅ **Shrinks: shards spread across peers** |
| Censorship resistance | ❌ Single server | ✅ Distributed | ✅ Distributed |
| Native HTTP serving | ✅ Yes | ❌ Needs gateway | ✅ Built-in |
| User-generated content | ✅ Yes | ❌ Complex | ✅ Built-in |
| Cost | ❌ Ongoing | ✅ Free (if pinned) | ✅ Free |
| Setup complexity | ❌ Complex | ❌ Complex | ✅ Single binary |

### The Core Promise: Hosting That Gets *Cheaper* As The Network Grows

Most decentralized systems get more expensive per node as you host more sites — every host stores a full copy of everything they pin. GrabNet is built the opposite way:

- **Global content-addressed dedup.** Every chunk is keyed by `BLAKE3(data)` in a single per-node `~/.grab/chunks` store. If two files in the same site, two revisions of the same site, or two completely unrelated sites share a chunk (a logo, a font, a JS library, an HTML boilerplate, an unchanged asset between revisions), it is **stored exactly once on disk**. Re-publishing a site after a small edit only adds the new chunks; archival history is preserved without paying for it twice.
- **Erasure-coded sharding (`--erasure 4+2`).** Instead of every host storing the full site, a chunk is split into `data + parity` Reed-Solomon shards (default 4+2 = 6). Each peer stores only 1–2 shards. Any 4 of 6 reconstruct the original. **Network-wide storage cost is 1.5× the site size instead of N×**, and per-node cost trends toward zero as more peers join — while loss tolerance stays at 33% of replicas.
- **Archival is never sacrificed.** Old revisions, unreferenced chunks, and pinned historical bundles are kept; dedup means archival storage is effectively free at the chunk level. Garbage collection is opt-in, never automatic.

This is the property that makes GrabNet viable in practice: **adding nodes makes the network lighter, not heavier**.

## Features

### Core Features

- **♻️ Native Chunk Deduplication** - All content is content-addressed by `BLAKE3(data)` in a single per-node chunk store. Identical chunks across files, revisions, and *unrelated sites* are stored exactly once. Archival history costs nothing extra.

- **🧮 Erasure-Coded Sharding** - Optional Reed-Solomon `--erasure data+parity` (e.g. `4+2`) splits each chunk into shards distributed across peers. Network cost stays ~1.5× the site size instead of N×, and per-node burden drops as more peers join. Any 4 of 6 shards reconstruct the chunk.

- **🔒 Stable Addresses** - Your site ID is `blake3(publisher_key || site_name)`. It never changes, even after thousands of updates.

- **⚡ Delta Sync** - Merkle tree diffing means only changed chunks are transferred. Update a 10MB site by sending just 50KB.

- **🌐 Native HTTP Gateway** - Serve sites directly over HTTP from any node. No external gateway required.

- **📦 Single Binary** - No Node.js, Python, or runtime dependencies. Just one Rust binary.

- **🔐 Cryptographic Ownership** - Ed25519 signatures prove you own your content. No one can impersonate your site.

- **📤 User Uploads** - Built-in support for user-generated content with configurable policies and moderation.

- **🗜️ Automatic Compression** - Gzip compression reduces bandwidth by 60-80% for text-based content.

### P2P Features

- **🔄 Persistent Identity** - Your peer ID is stable across restarts, making you discoverable on the network.

- **📌 Site Pinning** - Pin remote sites to host them locally and contribute to their availability.

- **🔁 Auto-Replication** - Sites you host automatically sync when publishers push updates.

- **👀 Watch Mode** - Develop with `--watch` flag for automatic republishing on file changes.

- **🔧 Deploy Hooks** - Run custom commands before and after publishing (build scripts, notifications, etc.).

### Technical Highlights

- **BLAKE3** for blazing-fast content hashing
- **Ed25519** for secure cryptographic signatures
- **libp2p** for proven P2P networking (Kademlia DHT, Gossipsub, Noise encryption)
- **sled** for embedded, zero-config database storage
- **axum** for high-performance HTTP serving

grab list

# Output:
# 📤 Published Sites:
#   personal-blog (rev 5)
#     ID: 7xK9pL2nMqR5tY8vW3bN6cF4hJ1dS9aE2gZ
#   
#   portfolio (rev 12)
#     ID: 9aB3cD5eF7gH1iJ3kL5mN7oP9qR1sT3uV
```

```bash
# Show detailed site information
grab info <name-or-id>

# Output:
# 📤 Published Site: personal-blog
#   Site ID:   7xK9pL2nMqR5tY8vW3bN6cF4hJ1dS9aE2gZ
#   Revision:  5
#   Path:      /home/user/sites/personal-blog
#   Files:     23
#   Entry:     index.html
```

### Gateway Commands

```bash
# Start HTTP gateway (default port 8080)
grab gateway

# Custom port
grab gateway --port 3000

# The gateway serves all your published and hosted sites
```

#### HTTPS / TLS

The gateway can terminate TLS directly with rustls — no reverse proxy required.

```bash
# Plain HTTPS on port 8443
grab gateway \
  --port 8443 \
  --tls-cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem \
  --tls-key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem

# Standard HTTPS on 443 with an HTTP -> HTTPS redirect on 80
sudo grab gateway \
  --port 80 \
  --https-port 443 \
  --tls-cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem \
  --tls-key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem \
  --default-site rootedrevival
```

When `--https-port` is supplied, `--port` becomes a permanent-redirect listener
(308) to the HTTPS origin. When it is omitted, the gateway listens for HTTPS
directly on `--port` and no plaintext listener is opened.

Certs are PEM-encoded; `fullchain.pem` from Let's Encrypt / certbot works as-is.
Cert/key reload requires a gateway restart.

**Gateway Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /health` | Health check |
| `GET /api/sites` | List all sites |
| `GET /api/sites/:id` | Get site info |
| `GET /api/sites/:id/manifest` | Get site manifest |
| `GET /site/:id/` | Serve site index |
| `GET /site/:id/*path` | Serve site files |
| `GET /ens/:name[/path]` | Resolve `<name>.eth` and 302-redirect to `/site/<id>/...` |
| `GET /` (with `Host:`) | Serve the site mapped to `Host:` via `--alias` or `--dns-aliases` |

#### Host-based routing — `--alias` and `--dns-aliases`

The gateway can serve different sites for different hostnames out of a single
process, the same way a traditional HTTP server uses virtual hosts.

```bash
# Static aliases (repeatable). Site reference is a local site name OR a base58 site id.
grab gateway --port 8080 \
  --alias rootedrevival.us=rootedrevival \
  --alias myblog.example=DGu4...8nF

# Dynamic aliases via DNS. For any host not in --alias, the gateway looks up
# `_grab.<host>` TXT records and caches results for the record's TTL.
grab gateway --port 8080 --dns-aliases
```

Publish a TXT record like this to make a domain resolve to a site:

```
_grab.example.com.   IN  TXT  "grab-site=DGu4VfkP6JwT1QmK2x9LzN8nF..."
```

Helpers:

```bash
grab dns record rootedrevival      # print the TXT record to publish
grab dns resolve rootedrevival.us  # query DNS and print the resolved site id
```

#### ENS resolution

```bash
# CLI
grab ens resolve rootedrevival.eth
grab ens resolve rootedrevival.eth --gateway https://your-ens-gw/text/{name}/grab-site

# HTTP — gateway-side redirect to /site/<resolved>/...
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8080/ens/rootedrevival.eth/
```

The default gateway is the public `api.ensideas.com` resolver; override with
`--gateway` (CLI) or by running your own ENS HTTP gateway. Set the ENS text
record `grab-site` to the base58 site id you want to resolve to.

#### CDN / edge caching

Because every chunk is content-addressed, gateway responses are
trivially cacheable:

- Strong **`ETag: "<full-blake3-hash>"`** on every file response
- **`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`** for static assets
  (HTML uses `public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` so site updates are visible)
- **`Vary: Accept-Encoding`** + on-the-wire gzip
- Tolerant `If-None-Match` parsing → cheap `304 Not Modified` responses

Stick any HTTP cache (Cloudflare, Varnish, Nginx, an edge worker) in front of
a `grab gateway` and it Just Works.

### Network Commands

```bash
# Start P2P node (full node - hosts content)
grab node start

# Connect to bootstrap peers on start
grab node start --bootstrap /ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...

# Light mode (no hosting, just publishing)
grab node start --light

# Custom port
grab node start --port 4002

# Connect to a specific peer
grab node connect /ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...

# Check node status
grab node status

# Stop the node
grab node stop
```

### Pinning Remote Sites

```bash
# Pin a site from the network
grab pin <site-id>

# Pin with a specific peer address
grab pin <site-id> --peer /ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooW...

# Example:
grab pin AtnArdZARzYJ7sTKYdrn4HHYsofuSe9gonDNsrqwFFa1 --peer /ip4/192.168.1.100/tcp/4001
```

This fetches the site from the network and hosts it locally. Your node will then serve the site to other peers and through the HTTP gateway.

### Hosting Commands

```bash
# Host (pin) a local site
grab host <site-id>

# Stop hosting a site
grab unhost <site-id>
```

### Key Management

```bash
# List all signing keys
grab keys list

# Output:
# 🔑 Keys:
#   default -> 5Ht7YkMnB3xR9pL2qW4sT6vU8wX0zA1cD...

# Generate a new key
grab keys generate my-key

# Export a key (for backup)
grab keys export my-key

# Import a key
grab keys import my-key <base58-private-key>
```

### Statistics

```bash
grab stats

# Output:
# 📊 Storage Statistics:
#   Chunks:          1,247
#   Total size:      45,234,567 bytes
#   Published sites: 3
#   Hosted sites:    12
```

### Global Options

```bash
--data-dir <path>   # Custom data directory (default: ~/.grab)
-v, --verbose       # Enable debug logging
-h, --help          # Show help
-V, --version       # Show version
```

## P2P Networking

GrabNet uses [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) for peer-to-peer networking with the following protocols:

### Protocols Used

| Protocol | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Kademlia DHT** | Peer discovery and content routing |
| **Gossipsub** | Real-time site announcements and updates |
| **mDNS** | Local network peer discovery |
| **Identify** | Peer identification and address exchange |
| **Noise** | Encrypted connections |

### Network Events

When running a node, you'll see events like:

```
🌐 Starting GrabNet node...
✓ Node started
  Peer ID: 12D3KooWMrzk1N4k9sqP4vxmii8rbqNymzJKDRYxtH5ZTuuqG21w

  🟢 Peer connected: 12D3KooWHK5mD...
  📢 Site announced: AtnArdZA... rev 3 from 12D3KooWHK5mD...
  ✓ Bootstrap complete, 5 peers
```

### Hosting Content

When you run a node, you:
1. **Announce** your published sites to the DHT
2. **Respond** to requests from other peers
3. **Replicate** content to help the network

Other nodes can find your sites by querying the DHT and request content directly.

### Auto-Replication

GrabNet automatically replicates content you're hosting:

1. **Site Announcements**: When a publisher announces a new revision via Gossipsub
2. **Revision Check**: If you're hosting that site and your revision is older
3. **Fetch Update**: Automatically request the new manifest and chunks
4. **Store Locally**: Save the updated content to serve to others

This ensures hosted sites stay up-to-date without manual intervention.

### Persistent Identity

Your peer ID is derived from an Ed25519 keypair stored in `~/.grab/keys.db`. This means:
- Your peer ID stays the same across restarts
- Other peers can reliably find you on the network
- Sites you announce remain discoverable

### Firewall Configuration

For best connectivity, open port 4001 (TCP) on your firewall. GrabNet also works behind NAT using the libp2p hole-punching and relay protocols.

### Data Flow

**Publishing:**
1. Scan directory for files
2. Chunk files (256KB default)
3. Hash each chunk with BLAKE3
4. Compress chunks with gzip
5. Build Merkle tree
6. Create manifest with file metadata
7. Sign bundle with Ed25519 private key
8. Store in local sled database
9. Announce to DHT (if network running)

**Serving:**
1. HTTP request comes in
2. Parse site ID from URL
3. Load manifest from storage
4. Resolve file path (clean URLs, SPA fallback)
5. Fetch chunks from storage
6. Decompress if needed
7. Return with proper Content-Type and caching headers

---

## Protocol Specification

### Site ID Generation

Site IDs are stable, deterministic identifiers:

```
site_id = BLAKE3(publisher_public_key || site_name)
```

This means:
- Same publisher + same name = same ID forever
- Different publishers can't claim your site names
- ID doesn't change when content updates

### WebBundle Format

```rust
struct WebBundle {
    site_id: [u8; 32],       // Stable identifier
    name: String,             // Human-readable name
    revision: u64,            // Auto-incrementing version
    root_hash: [u8; 32],      // Merkle root of all content
    publisher: [u8; 32],      // Ed25519 public key
    signature: Vec<u8>,       // Ed25519 signature (64 bytes)
    manifest: SiteManifest,   // File listings and routing
    created_at: u64,          // Unix timestamp (milliseconds)
}

struct SiteManifest {
    files: Vec<FileEntry>,
    entry: String,            // Default: "index.html"
    routes: Option<RouteConfig>,
    headers: Option<Vec<HeaderRule>>,
}

struct FileEntry {
    path: String,             // Relative path
    hash: [u8; 32],           // Content hash
    size: u64,                // Original size
    mime_type: String,        // MIME type
    chunks: Vec<[u8; 32]>,    // Chunk IDs
    compression: Option<Compression>,
}
```

### Signature Verification

Bundles are signed to prove authenticity:

```
message = site_id || revision (as u64 LE bytes) || root_hash
signature = Ed25519_Sign(private_key, message)
```

Anyone can verify:
```
Ed25519_Verify(publisher_public_key, message, signature)
```

### Network Messages

| Message | Direction | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `FindSite(site_id)` | Request | Find nodes hosting a site |
| `SiteHosts(peers)` | Response | List of hosting peers |
| `GetManifest(site_id, rev)` | Request | Fetch site manifest |
| `Manifest(data)` | Response | Serialized manifest |
| `GetChunks(chunk_ids)` | Request | Fetch content chunks |

## User Uploads

GrabNet supports user-generated content for dynamic websites.

### Enable Uploads (SDK)

```rust
use grabnet::{Grab, UploadPolicy, ModerationMode};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let grab = Grab::with_uploads(None).await?;
    
    grab.enable_uploads(&site_id, UploadPolicy {
        max_file_size: 10 * 1024 * 1024,      // 10 MB per file
        max_storage_per_user: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100 MB total per user
        allowed_types: vec![
            "image/*".into(),
            "video/mp4".into(),
            "application/pdf".into(),
        ],
        moderation: ModerationMode::Pre,       // Review before visible
        rate_limit: 60,                         // 60 uploads per hour
        ..Default::default()
    })?;
    
    grab.start_gateway().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Upload via HTTP

```bash
# Upload a file
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/sites/{site_id}/uploads \
  -H "Content-Type: image/png" \
  -H "X-Upload-Filename: avatar.png" \
  -H "X-User-Id: user123" \
  --data-binary @avatar.png

# Response:
# {
#   "upload_id": "upl_7xK9pL2nMq...",
#   "url": "/uploads/upl_7xK9pL2nMq...",
#   "status": "pending_review"
# }
```

### Moderation Modes

- `None` - No moderation, uploads immediately visible
- `Pre` - Uploads must be approved before visible
- `Post` - Uploads visible immediately, can be removed later

GrabNet stores configuration at `~/.grab/config.json`:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "port": 4001,
    "listen_addresses": ["/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4001"],
    "bootstrap_peers": [
      "/ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/p2p/QmaCpDMG..."
    ],
    "max_connections": 100
  },
  "gateway": {
    "port": 8080,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "cors": true
  },
  "storage": {
    "cache_size_mb": 256,
    "max_storage_gb": 0
  },
  "publisher": {
    "chunk_size": 262144,
    "compress": true
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| `network.max_connections` | `100` | Maximum peer connections |
| `gateway.port` | `8080` | HTTP gateway port |
| `gateway.host` | `127.0.0.1` | Gateway bind address |
| `gateway.cors` | `true` | Enable CORS headers |
| `storage.cache_size_mb` | `256` | In-memory chunk cache |
| `storage.max_storage_gb` | `0` | Max storage (0 = unlimited) |

## SDK Usage

### Basic Publishing

```rust
use grabnet::{Grab, PublishOptions};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create instance (uses ~/.grab by default)
    let grab = Grab::new(None).await?;
    
    // Publish a website
    let result = grab.publish("./my-website", PublishOptions {
        name: Some("my-site".into()),
        compress: true,
        ..Default::default()
    }).await?;
    
    println!("Published: grab://{}", result.bundle.site_id);
    println!("Revision: {}", result.bundle.revision);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Running the Gateway

```rust
use grabnet::Grab;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let grab = Grab::new(None).await?;
    
    // Start gateway on custom port
    grab.start_gateway_on_port(3000).await?;
    
    println!("Gateway running on http://127.0.0.1:3000");
    
    // Keep running until Ctrl+C
    tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await?;
    grab.stop_gateway().await?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Hosting Remote Sites

```rust
use grabnet::{Grab, SiteId, SiteIdExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let grab = Grab::new(None).await?;
    
    // Start network to discover sites
    grab.start_network().await?;
    
    // Host someone else's site
    let site_id = SiteId::from_base58("7xK9pL2nMqR5tY8vW3bN6cF4hJ1dS9aE2gZ")
        .expect("Invalid site ID");
    
    if grab.host(&site_id).await? {
        println!("Now hosting site!");
    } else {
        println!("Site not found on network");
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Address already in use"

Another process is using the port:

```bash
# Find what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080

# Kill the process or use a different port
grab gateway --port 8081
```

### "Could not acquire lock"

Another grab process has the database open:

```bash
# Kill any running grab processes
pkill -9 grab

# Try again
grab gateway
```

### Site not loading in browser

1. Check the gateway is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
   # Should return: {"status":"ok","gateway":"grabnet"}
   ```

2. Verify the site exists:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/sites
   ```

3. Check you're using the full site ID with trailing slash:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/FULL_SITE_ID_HERE/
   ```

### Manifest deserialization errors

This usually means the database is corrupted or from an incompatible version:

```bash
# Backup and reset
mv ~/.grab ~/.grab.backup
grab publish ./my-site --name my-site
```

### Debug logging

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
grab -v gateway

# Or set environment variable
RUST_LOG=grabnet=debug grab gateway
```

## Roadmap

- [x] **HTTPS/TLS Support** - Built-in TLS termination via rustls (`--tls-cert` / `--tls-key` / `--https-port`)
- [x] **DNS Integration** - `_grab.<host>` TXT record resolution with TTL-respecting cache (`--dns-aliases`, `grab dns resolve`, `grab dns record`)
- [x] **Static Host Aliases** - Map any `Host:` header to a site at gateway start (`--alias host=site`, repeatable)
- [x] **CDN / Edge Caching** - Strong BLAKE3 ETags, `Cache-Control: immutable` for content-addressed assets, `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, gzip on the wire
- [x] **ENS Integration** - Resolve `*.eth` site ids via a configurable HTTPS gateway (`grab ens resolve`, `/ens/<name>` route)
- [x] **Browser Extension** - MV3 omnibox keyword + in-page `grab://` link rewriter ([`extension/grabnet-resolver`](extension/grabnet-resolver))
- [ ] **Economic Incentives** - Token-based hosting rewards
- [ ] **WASM Browser Nodes** - Run nodes directly in browsers
- [ ] **Mobile Apps** - iOS/Android gateway apps
